AIUR - AutoInstallUpdateRemove -- A test project for ComputerCraft.

This test project is used to develop a system for install and
autoupdate of programs in ComputerCraft.

The program uses pastebin for the install file, and github for
other programfiles.

STATUS: ALPHA (Nothing working)

Test the program here: http://pastebin.com/GWkbq6cn

Planned future features:
  * Use pastebin/github option for files
  * Option to install in any subfolder, instead of root.
  * Automagic adding AIUR functionality to multi file programs.
